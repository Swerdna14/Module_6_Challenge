# Module_6_Challenge

In this challenge, we will be looking at housing and rent prices throughout neighbourhoods in San Francisco.
The objective is to ultimately see if there has been any trends relating to those two and whether they have been consistent throughout all neighbourhoods in San Francisco.
Lastly, a geoplot was created to see exactly where in San Francisco these neighbourhoods are while also displaying the gross rent and sales per square foot to better understand the data.
